Debugging:
 If you'd like to try the built-in debugging commands...
  :MatchDebug      to activate debugging for the current buffer
 This saves the values of several key script variables as buffer-local
 variables.  See the MatchDebug() function, below, for details.

TODO:  I should think about multi-line patterns for b:match_words.
  This would require an option:  how many lines to scan (default 1).
  This would be useful for Python, maybe also for *ML.
TODO:  Maybe I should add a menu so that people will actually use some of
  the features that I have implemented.
TODO:  Eliminate the MultiMatch function.  Add yet another argument to
  Match_wrapper() instead.
TODO:  Allow :let b:match_words = '\(\(foo\)\(bar\)\):\3\2:end\1'
TODO:  Make backrefs safer by using '\V' (very no-magic).
TODO:  Add a level of indirection, so that custom % scripts can use my
  work but extend it.
